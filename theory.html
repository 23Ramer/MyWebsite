          <p>Get to know the people you will be playing against. Get to know their tells, their signs of weaknesses and most importantly their signs of strength.

          <p>Monopoly is a game that allows players to learn who is smart and who is poor. Players take turns rolling the dice to move their game token across the board. While traveling around the board players have to buy propities and collect a set of propities. Once they do that they will be able to upgade the propities they have and make money off them. If a player lands on a proprity they don't own, they have to pay the player who owns it money. You win if everyone else becomes bunkrupt and can't pay any one else.</p>
