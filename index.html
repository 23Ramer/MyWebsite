          <p id="subintropad">As times change with new advances in technology, it is important to not cut out the most human parts of our social interaction. Or bascily, play boardgames. There are a vast variety of boardgames that exist in the world, and all of them have the same type of interaction in them. I decided to create this website to showcase all the differnt kinds of games out there so different people can learn about them and, hopefully, try them out for themselves.</p>

          <p>I started this website in 2018 in my freshman year
                    of high school. It took some time to get the
                    idea of making it down, but it has all culminated
                     the creation of this website. </p>

          <p>I like to use Adobe Photoshop to stuff. Like making a
                    photo with five members of the rat pack instead
                     of four, the fifth being a teacher of busieness
                     ... and photos of Vader.<p>
